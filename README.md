This repository is for the different builds of my Quarto files made to answer questions based on the provided SQL database.

Build 1 - Very basic, early build. Packages installed, SQL database linked to QMD.

Build 2 - Some formatting adjusting, database display issues resolved.

Build 3 - Tables added from the database. (dbGetQuery)

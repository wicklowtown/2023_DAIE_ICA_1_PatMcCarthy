The findings are visually represented through a plot, such as the scatter plot I’ve provided below.\nInterpret: By examining the coefficients of the model, we aim to find a huge number of insights relevant to the betterment of game development. We can see on a country to country basis, the size of teams, the budget allocated to games, who the top developers are, and more - which can be used to make smarter choices when say, a studio is deciding where to invest in when making a game.\nDiscuss: Linear regression relies on the assumption that the connection between variables is linear. If this assumption is broken, suggesting the actual relationship is nonlinear, the model might not give accurate predictions. It also doesn’t account for outliers in its predictions, of which there could be many."
